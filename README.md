How Maestro is created:
=======================

If you are building a Maestro image for your cloud, do the following:

This tool is based on hpcloud cli. You have to install it before. See http://docs.hpcloud.com/cli/unix

* Configuring cloud credential

* Starting your build
    $ cd build
    $ bin/build.sh --box-name maestro --build-conf-dir conf

it will create a Maestro box image, by building a server and snapshooting it.

maestro requires a proto2b image to be built before.

To build proto2b image, use the following:

    $ bin/build.sh --box-name proto2b
