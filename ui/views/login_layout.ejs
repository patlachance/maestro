        Stylesheets and Preprocessors
        ==============================

        You can always bring in CSS files manually with `link` tags, or asynchronously
        on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
        take advantage of Sails' boilerplate asset management.

        By default, stylesheets from your `assets/linker/styles` folder are included
        here automatically.  Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less) are supported.
        In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into a single file.
        
        To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:
            
            + Change the order of your CSS files
            + Import stylesheets from other directories
            + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus
    -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/linker/styles/bootstrap-theme.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/linker/styles/bootstrap.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/linker/styles/site.css">
    <!--

      Client-side Javascript
      ========================

      You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
      on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
      take advantage of Sails' boilerplate asset management.

      By default, filesin your `assets/linker/js` folder are included here
      automatically.  Both JavaScript (.js) and CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported.
      In production, your scripts will be minified and concatenated into a single file.
      
      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:
          
          + Change the order of your scripts
          + Import scripts from other directories
          + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
